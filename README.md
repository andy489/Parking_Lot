# ParkingLot
Basic Parking Lot 

Create a REST service to manage sales for a paid parking lot. Use Java 11+ and any framework or 3rd party libs of your choice (Spring, JavaEE, etc). Use a relational database of your choice (and provide the schema) â€“ i.e MySQL, PostGreSql, H2. Include a Maven or Gradle build for the project.

### Business requirements:
    - The parking lot has 50 car spots and 10 bus spots;
	- For cars hourly price is EUR 1 while the 24hr price is EUR 10;
    - For buses hourly price is EUR 5 while 24hr price is EUR 40;
	- Sales are generated when a vehicle leaves the parking lot.

### The REST service should have all necessary methods to:
    - Record occupancy;
    - Record sales.

### Optional, for bonus points:
 - Provide REST method generating an itemized report of sales given a date range;
 - Protect the REST service using basic authentication;
 - Provide some unit tests.

Deliver project via a GitHub shared repository or a Zip file.
